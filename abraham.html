    <h1>Abraham</h1>
    <div class="ab">
        Abraham the father of all nation as biblically presented. Abraham, Hebrew Avraham, originally called
        abram or, in Hebrew, Avram, (flourished early 2nd miillenium BCE), the first of the Hebrew patriachs and a
        fiqure revered by the three great monotheustic religions-judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Acording to
        the biblical book of Genesis, Abraham left Ur, in Mesopotamia, because God called him to found a new nation
        in an undesignated land that he later learned was canaan. He obeyed unquestioningly the commands of God,
        from whom he recived repeated promises and covenant that his "seed" would inherit the land.
        In judaism the promised offspring is understood to be the Jewish people descended from Abraham's son,
        Isaac, born of his wife Sarah. Smililarly, in Christianity the genealogy of Jesus is traced to Isaac and
        Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac is seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. In Islam it is
        Ishmeal, Abraham's firstborn son, born of Hagar, who is viewed as the fulfillment of God's promise, and the
        prophet Muhammad
        is his descendant.
